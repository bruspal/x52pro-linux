@mainpage Saitek X52/X52Pro drivers for Linux/Unix

@section intro Introduction

libx52 is an open source library that allows you to communicate with a
Saitek X52 or Saitek X52Pro joystick on Linux and Unix machines. Saitek
only provides Windows drivers for their joysticks, necessitating the need
for this project for users to be able to control the LEDs and MFD text on
a Linux or Unix device.

This documentation is intended for application developers who wish to use
the features of this library to communicate with supported devices.

@section start Getting Started

See the @ref libx52_integration page for details on how to integrate libx52
with your application.

@section features Library Features

libx52 supports setting the following parameters on the joystick

1. Text on the multifunction display (MFD).
2. All 3 clocks on the MFD.
4. Date display on the MFD.
5. Blinking of the POV hat and clutch LEDs (both blinking or not).
6. Shift indicator on the MFD.
7. Setting the color of the individual LEDs (*on the X52 Pro only*).
