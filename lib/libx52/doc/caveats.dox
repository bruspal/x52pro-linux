/**
@page libx52_caveats Caveats

@section general General Caveats

libx52 uses [libusb](https://libusb.info) under the hood. Therefore, any
[caveats](http://libusb.sourceforge.net/api-1.0/libusb_caveats.html) that apply
to libusb also apply to libx52.

@section threads Thread Safety

libx52 is not designed to be thread-safe. The application must ensure that
calls to libx52 from multiple threads are protected by a semaphore/mutex.

@section leds LED Support

The Saitek X52 does not support controlling the color of individual LEDs. This
is only supported on the X52 Pro. The application can use \ref
libx52_check_feature to verify support.
